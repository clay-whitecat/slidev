The highlighting is done by adding token classes to the code and it's colored using CSS. You can browse through their official themes, or create/customize one yourself very easily using prism-theme-vars.Shiki is a TextMate grammar-powered syntax highlighter. It generates colored tokens, so there is no additional CSS needed. Since it has great grammar support, the generated colors are very accurate, just like what you will see in VS Code. Shiki also comes with a bunch of built-in themes. In Slidev, we also provided the TwoSlash support is also built-in.Slidev themes usually support both Prism and Shiki, but depending on the theme you are using, it might only support one of them.When you have the choice, the tradeoff is basically:Prism for easier customizationShiki for accurate highlightingSlidev uses Shiki by default since v0.47.
