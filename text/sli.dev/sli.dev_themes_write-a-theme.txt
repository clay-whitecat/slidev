You can also refer to the official themes as examples.Capability ​A theme can contribute to the following points:Global stylesProvide default configurations (fonts, color schema, highlighters, etc.)Provide custom layouts or override the existing oneProvide custom components or override the existing oneExtend UnoCSS/Windi CSS configurationsConfigure tools like Monaco and PrismConventions ​Themes are published to npm registry, and they should follow the conventions below:Package name should start with slidev-theme-, for example: slidev-theme-awesomeAdd slidev-theme and slidev in the keywords field of your package.jsonSetup ​To set up the testing playground for your theme, you can create example.md with the following frontmatter, to tell Slidev you are using the current directory as a theme.md---
theme: ./
---Optionally, you can also add some scripts to your packages.jsonjson// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "slidev example.md",
    "build": "slidev build example.md",
    "export": "slidev export example.md",
    "screenshot": "slidev export example.md --format png"
  }
}To publish your theme, simply run npm publish and you are good to go. There is no build process required (which means you can directly publish .vue and .ts files, Slidev is smart enough to understand them).Theme contribution points follow the same conventions as local customization, please refer to the docs for the naming conventions.Default Configurations ​Available since v0.19A theme can provide default configurations via package.json.json// package.json
{
  "slidev": {
    "defaults": {
      "aspectRatio": "16/9",
      "canvasWidth": 980,
      "fonts": {
        "sans": "Robot",
        "mono": "Fira Code"
      }
    }
  }
}Fonts will be auto imported from Google Fonts.Learn more about fonts and frontmatter configurations.Theme Metadata ​Color Schema ​By default, Slidev assumes themes support both light mode and dark mode. If you only want your theme be presented in a designed color schema, you will need to specify it explicitly in package.jsonjson// package.json
{
  "name": "slidev-theme-my-cool-theme",
  "keywords": [
    "slidev-theme",
    "slidev"
  ],
  "slidev": {
    "colorSchema": "light" // or "dark" or "both"
  }
}To access the dark mode when creating your theme styles, you can wrap the dark-mode-specific css inside a dark class:css/* general css here */

html:not(.dark) {
  /* light mode css here */
}

html.dark {
  /* dark mode css here */
}Slidev toggles a dark class on the page's html element for switching color schema.Highlighter ​Syntax highlighting colors are also provided in the theme. We support both Prism, Shiki. For more information please refer to the syntax highlighting docs.You can support either one of them, or both. Refer to the default theme for configurations examples ./styles/code.css / ./setup/shiki.ts.Also, remember to specify the supported highlighters in your package.jsonjson// package.json
{
  "slidev": {
    "highlighter": "shiki" // or "prism" or "both"
  }
}Slidev Version ​If the theme is relying on a specific feature of Slidev that are newly introduced, you can set the minimal Slidev version required to have your theme working properly:json// package.json
{
  "engines": {
    "slidev": ">=0.19.3"
  }
}If users are using older versions of Slidev, an error will be thrown. Suggest changes to this pagePrevious pageTheme GalleryNext pageUse AddonReleased under the MIT License.Copyright © 2020 Anthony Fu.
