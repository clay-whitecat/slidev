Project description



Welcome to Streamlit 👋
A faster way to build and share data apps.
Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our Community Cloud platform to deploy, manage, and share your app.
Installation
Open a terminal and run:
$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello

If this opens our sweet Streamlit Hello app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to our docs for specific installs.
The app features a bunch of examples of what you can do with Streamlit. Jump to the quickstart section to understand how that all works.

Quickstart
A little example
Create a new file streamlit_app.py with the following code:
import streamlit as st
x = st.slider("Select a value")
st.write(x, "squared is", x * x)

Now run it to open the app!
$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py


Give me more!
Streamlit comes in with a ton of additional powerful elements to spice up your data apps and delight your viewers. Some examples:


































Input widgets
Dataframes
Charts
Layout
Multi-page apps
Fun


Our vibrant creators community also extends Streamlit capabilities using  🧩 Streamlit Components.
Get inspired
There's so much you can build with Streamlit:

🤖  LLMs & chatbot apps
🧬  Science & technology apps
💬  NLP & language apps
🏦  Finance & business apps
🗺  Geography & society apps
and more!
