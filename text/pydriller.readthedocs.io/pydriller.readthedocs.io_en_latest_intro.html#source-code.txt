Overview / Install
PyDriller is a Python framework that helps developers on mining software repositories. With PyDriller you can easily extract information from any Git repository, such as commits, developers, modifications, diffs, and source codes, and quickly export CSV files.


Requirements

Python 3.4 or newer
Git



Installing PyDriller
Installing PyDriller is easily done using pip. Assuming it is installed, just run the following from the command-line:
# pip install pydriller


This command will download the latest version of GitPython from the
Python Package Index and install it
to your system. This will also install the necessary dependencies.


Source Code
PyDriller’s git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:


https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller


and cloned using:
$ git clone https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller
$ cd pydriller


Optionally (but suggested), make use of virtualenv:
$ virtualenv -p python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate


Install the requirements:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r test-requirements.txt
$ unzip test-repos.zip


and run the tests using pytest:
$ pytest

    abstract = "Software repositories contain historical and valuable information about the overall development of software systems. Mining software repositories (MSR) is nowadays considered one of the most interesting growing fields within software engineering. MSR focuses on extracting and analyzing data available in software repositories to uncover interesting, useful, and actionable information about the system. Even though MSR plays an important role in software engineering research, few tools have been created and made public to support developers in extracting information from Git repository. In this paper, we present PyDriller, a Python Framework that eases the process of mining Git. We compare our tool against the state-of-the-art Python Framework GitPython, demonstrating that PyDriller can achieve the same results with, on average, 50% less LOC and significantly lower complexity.URL: https://github.com/ishepard/pydrillerMaterials: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327363Pre-print: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1327411",
