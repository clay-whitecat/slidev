Welcome¶

Sphinx makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation.

Here are some of Sphinx’s major features:

Output formats: HTML (including Windows HTML Help), LaTeX (for printable
PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text
Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links for
functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of
information
Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
links to siblings, parents and children
Automatic indices: general index as well as a language-specific module
indices
Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
Extensions: automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings
from Python modules (API docs) via built-in extensions, and much more functionality via third-party
extensions.
Themes: modify the look and feel of outputs via creating themes, and reuse many third-party themes.
Contributed extensions: dozens of extensions contributed by users; most of them installable from PyPI.

Sphinx uses the reStructuredText markup language by default, and can read
MyST markdown via third-party extensions. Both of these
are powerful and straightforward to use, and have functionality
for complex documentation and publishing workflows. They both build upon
Docutils to parse and write documents.
See below for how to navigate Sphinx’s documentation.
